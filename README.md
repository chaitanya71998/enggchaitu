## 👋 About Me

Hey, I’m **Chaitanya Sai Terli** – a frontend specialist who *studied Mechanical Engineering* but found his true passion in **building powerful web products** that people love to use.

With over **5+ years** of experience, I’ve:

- Built and scaled products with **React**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, **Cypress**, **Docker**, and more.

I enjoy creating systems that are **clean, performant, and maintainable** — and mentoring junior devs while doing it.
